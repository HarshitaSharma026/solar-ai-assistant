# 🔆 Solar Rooftop AI Assistant

This project is an AI-powered assistant that helps assess the solar installation potential of rooftops using image captioning, solar panel estimation logic, and large language models.

It was built as part of an AI internship assessment and demonstrates skills in:

- LangChain (LLM pipelines)
- Streamlit (frontend UI)
- Pydantic (data validation)
- Image captioning (via BLIP, Bootstrapping Language-Image Pre-training for Unified Vision-Language Understanding and Generation)
- Solar panel cost & ROI estimation

---

## Features

- Upload or link a rooftop image
- Extracts a descriptive caption using an AI vision model
- Takes additional user input like roof area, orientation, material, etc.
- Calculates:
  - Estimated panel size
  - Cost and ROI
  - Feasibility
- Generates a natural language recommendation using a Large Language Model (LLM)
- Deployable via Streamlit Cloud

---

## Tech Stack

- Python 3.10+
- Streamlit
- LangChain + Gemini
- Pydantic (for validation)
- Langchain ```ImageCaptionLoader``` (for vision models)

## Project Structure

**app.py**: Streamlit UI
**backend.py**: Core backend logic + validation
**utils.py**: solar estimation function
**requirements.txt**: python dependencies


## Getting Started (Local)

### 1. Clone the Repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HarshitaSharma026/solar-ai-assistant.git
cd solar-ai-assistant
```

### 2. Create virtual environment (optional but recommended)
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Set your API keys
Create a ```.env``` file in root directory.

### 5. Run the app
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
This will start a local streamlut app in your browser.
